#### **Key Features:**
1. **Symptom Input & Suggestions:**
   - Users can input symptoms directly or receive intelligent suggestions for symptom corrections based on close matches.
   - A robust symptom database ensures comprehensive coverage of possible ailments.

2. **Machine Learning-Powered Predictions:**
   - A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to analyze symptoms and provide initial disease probabilities based on training data.
   - The system encodes symptoms into one-hot vectors, processes them through CNN layers, and outputs disease probabilities.

3. **Fuzzy Logic Refinement:**
   - Fuzzy logic rules are applied to enhance prediction accuracy by incorporating symptom intensity.
   - This approach ensures that the severity of symptoms contributes to more nuanced and realistic disease probabilities.

4. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Extensive data cleaning ensures standardized symptom and disease names, reducing redundancy and improving system accuracy.
   - Missing values in disease descriptions and precautions are handled seamlessly to provide reliable outputs.

5. **Interactive Disease Details:**
   - The system provides detailed descriptions and a ranked list of diseases based on prediction probabilities.
   - Precautionary measures for top-predicted diseases are displayed, enabling proactive healthcare management.

6. **Visual Insights:**
   - Visual heatmaps showcase the relationship between symptoms and diseases.
   - Bar charts represent refined disease probabilities, enhancing user comprehension.

#### **Workflow Overview:**

1. **Input Symptoms:**
   - Users input symptoms and their intensities, which are processed for initial predictions using the trained CNN model.

2. **Prediction Generation:**
   - The model outputs disease probabilities, which are further refined using fuzzy logic for greater accuracy.

3. **Result Visualization:**
   - Predicted probabilities are visualized, and users can view disease descriptions and associated precautionary measures.

4. **Personalized Disease Insights:**
   - Based on refined predictions, users can access top disease details for a deeper understanding of potential conditions.
